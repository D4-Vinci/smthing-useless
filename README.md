# Anti Gravity üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Thermo Nuclear


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Tino Tyson - ICCS College of Engineering and Management
- Member 2: Adhithyan P. B. - ICCS College of Engineering and Management

### Project Description
A simple web-based project developed in HTML, CSS, and Java Script. The entire code is made in a single snippet. Using various tools such as ChatGPT and Git the development, execution and publishing of this software was made possible.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The way water pours downwards, doesn't look unnatural enough.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Making the water fall in the opposite direction of gravity.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML, CSS, Java Script, GD Script
- Chat GPT, Git, Godot, VS Code, VIM

For Hardware:
- Accelerometer/Gyroscope
- Set the meters, in such a way that that the entire gravity was calculated well enough for the human brain to consider it gravity.
- Basic Java Script implementations, allowed for the manipulation we needed.
